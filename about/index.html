      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At Now Mindful, we believe mindfulness can be found in the present moment—especially when we're in a state of play. Our mission is to create playful, relaxed settings where mindfulness feels less like a chore and more like an adventure.</p>
      <p>Whether through gamified meditation, technology projects, or engaging talks, we're here to spark the realization that mindfulness is available to everyone.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2022, Now Mindful began as an initiative to teach mantra meditation online. As we grew, we noticed how hard it can be to access meditation teachings in a world that values constant outward productivity. We knew it was time to take a different approach—one that makes mindfulness feel natural and approachable, no matter your starting point.</p>
      <p>Our journey is deeply personal. Mindfulness became an anchor for our founder, David, during a challenging time as a carer for his sister. It helped ease the fear of death and unlocked a new perspective on life. That transformative experience shaped the heart of Now Mindful—helping others discover the freedom mindfulness can offer.</p>
